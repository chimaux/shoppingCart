This JavaScript code is an e-commerce mini project that fetches product information 

from a fake store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products). 

The code uses the fetch API to make a GET request to the API and retrieve the JSON response.

The code then loops through the returned product information, creates HTML elements for each product, 

and appends them to a product section element on the page. The code also includes a 

function to add products to a cart.

Each product element has a button with a class of "addToCart," and when the button is clicked, 

the product's information (name, price, and image) is added to an array called "myArray." 

The total price of the items in the cart is calculated and displayed on the page.

In summary, this code creates a simple e-commerce product display and cart system that fetches 

data from an API and displays it on the page.


This JavaScript code has the following basic functionalities:

    1) Fetches data from an API and retrieves JSON formatted data.

    2) Handles errors and logs them to the console in case of any failure during fetching.

    3) Displays the fetched data as a list of products, each with a title, image, price, and add-to-cart button.

    4) Keeps track of the total price of the added items in the shopping cart.

    5) Adds products to the shopping cart when the add-to-cart button is clicked.
    
    6) The collected product data is stored in a local array called "myArray".
